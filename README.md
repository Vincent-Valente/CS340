**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I prioritize modularity, consistent naming conventions, concise comments, adherence to style guidelines, and regular code reviews. For Project One, the CRUD module clearly segmented database operations, enhancing readability and future adaptability. Advantages of working in this way include using a standalone CRUD module decouples database interactions from the main application, allowing for easy modifications and potential reuse in other projects.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**

I begin by understanding the client's requirements, then plan and design a solution. I break down the overall problem into smaller tasks and adopt an iterative development process. For the Grazioso Salvare project, this meant selecting appropriate tools, designing the dashboard, and refining based on feedback. Differences from previous assignments include the fact that this project demanded a holistic solution integrating multiple tools and a deeper grasp of the client's specific needs. A future database creation strategy I would use is to assess data scale and complexity, choose a suitable database type, and factor in scalability and potential data usage patterns.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**

Computer scientists develop technology solutions addressing diverse challenges. Our work fosters innovation and efficiency across sectors. This project's impact on Grazioso Salvare
dashbpard enhanced Grazioso Salvare's ability to identify rescue dogs efficiently, facilitating quicker, informed decisions and positively impacting animal rescue operations.
